<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Ruby**:

### Install

To install on Mac Os run following commands:

```sh
 brew install rbenv ruby-build
# Add rbenv to bash so that it loads every time you open a terminal
echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

# Install Ruby
rbenv install 3.0.1
rbenv global 3.0.1
ruby -v
```
Installing Ruby on Windows is a little more difficult than installing it on another OS. We would recommend using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), but you can also try to install Ruby directly on your OS with [rubyinstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/).

Note:
`WSL only works on 64-bit installations of Windows.`

If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows 10, we recommend following [this](https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10) article to install Ruby.

If you can not use WSL then you should follow these steps:

- Download the last version of [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
- Run RubyInstaller and follow the steps described [here](https://stackify.com/install-ruby-on-windows-everything-you-need-to-get-going/).

If you are familiar with [docker](https://www.docker.com/), you could also use it.

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone git@github.com:shella12/MorseDecoder.git
```

### Usage

If you have ruby installed in your PC the simply start IRB(**Interactive Ruby Shell**) on terminal using:

```sh
  $ irb

```

Thats it now you can execute your program on termonal:)
